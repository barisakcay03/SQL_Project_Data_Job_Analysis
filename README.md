### The questions i wanted to answer through my SQL queries were:
1. What are the top-paying data analyst jobs?
2. What skills are required for the top-paying jobs?
3. What skills are the most in demand for data analysis?
4. Which skills are associated with higher salaries?
5. What are the most optimal skills to learn?

# Tools I Used
For my deep dive into the data analyst job market , I harnessed the power of several key tools:
- **SQL:** The backbone of my analysis, allowing me to query the database and unearth critical insights.
- PostgreSQL: The choosen database management system, ideal for hangling the job posting data.
- Visual Studio Code: My go-to for data management and executing SQL queries.
- Git & Github: Essential for version control and sharing my SQL scripts and analysis, ensuring collaboration and project tracking.

# The Analysis
Each query for this project aimed at investigating spesific aspects of the data analysis job market. Here's how i approached each question:

### 1. Top Paying Data Analysis Jobs
To identify the highest-paying roles I filtered data analyst positions by average yearly salary and location, focusing on remote jobs. This query highlights the high paying opportunities in the field:

```sql
SELECT
   job_id,
   job_title,
   job_location,
   job_schedule_type,
   salary_year_avg,
   job_posted_date,
   name AS company_name
FROM
   job_postings_fact
LEFT JOIN company_dim ON job_postings_fact.company_id = company_dim.company_id
WHERE
   job_title_short = 'Data Analyst' AND 
   job_location = 'Anywhere' AND
   salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY
   salary_year_avg DESC
LIMIT 10
```
Here's the breakdown of the top data analyst jobs in 2023:
- **Wide Salary Range:** Top 10 paying data analyst roles span from $184.000 to $650.000, indicating significant salary potential in the field.
- **Diverse Employers:** Companies like SmartAssert, Meta, and AT&T are among those offering high salaries, showing a broad interest across different industries.
